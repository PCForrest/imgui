## How to Build     

### Using CMake
#### Building for desktop (WebGPU-native) with Google Dawn:
 1. `git clone https://github.com/google/dawn dawn`
 2. `cmake -B build -DIMGUI_DAWN_DIR=dawn`
 3. `cmake --build build`
The resulting binary will be found at one of the following locations:
  * build/Debug/example_sdl2_wgpu[.exe]
  * build/example_sdl2_wgpu[.exe]

#### Building for desktop (WebGPU-Native) with WGPU:
 1. download WGPU-Native autogenerated binary modules for your platform/compiler from: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/releases
 2. unzip the downloaded file in `your_preferred_folder`
 3. move into `your_preferred_folder` (e.g. typing: `cd your_preferred_folder`)
 4. `cmake -B build -DIMGUI_WGPU_DIR=your_preferred_folder`  ("full path" or "relative" starting from current directory)
 5. `cmake --build build`
The resulting binary will be found at one of the following locations:
  * build/Debug/example_sdl2_wgpu[.exe]
  * build/example_sdl2_wgpu[.exe]

#### Building for Emscripten:
At current date (Jul/2025) there is no official support for SDL3 in EMSCRIPTEN, and its use in EMSCRIPTEN is also in the experimental phase.
To use SDL3 with EMSCRIPTEN you need to download the SDL3 repository (source code) and build the libraries for EMSCRIPTEN following the official page: 
https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/README-emscripten#building-sdlemscripten

- the SDL3 library will be built in `your_SDL3_folder/build`

 1. Install Emscripten SDK following the instructions: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
 2. Install Ninja build system
 3. `emcmake cmake -DIMGUI_SDL3_EMSCRIPTEN_DIR=your_SDL3_folder -G Ninja -B build`
 4. `cmake --build build`

To run:
 - `emrun build/index.html`

or
 - `python -m http.server`  then open WGPU browser with url: `http://localhost:8000/build`
 
### Using makefile 

- You need to install Emscripten from https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html, and have the environment variables set, as described in https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#installation-instructions

- Depending on your configuration, in Windows you may need to run `emsdk/emsdk_env.bat` in your console to access the Emscripten command-line tools.

- You may also refer to our [Continuous Integration setup](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/.github/workflows) for Emscripten setup.

- Then build using `make -f Makefile.emscripten` while in the `example_glfw_wgpu/` directory.

- Requires recent Emscripten as WGPU is still a work-in-progress API.

## How to Run

To run on a local machine:
- Make sure your browse supports WGPU and it is enabled. WGPU is still WIP not enabled by default in most browser.
- `make serve` will use Python3 to spawn a local webserver, you can then browse http://localhost:8000 to access your build.
- Otherwise, generally you will need a local webserver:
  - Quoting [https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html#generating-html):<br>
_"Unfortunately several browsers (including Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer) do not support file:// [XHR](https://emscripten.org/docs/site/glossary.html#term-xhr) requests, and can’t load extra files needed by the HTML (like a .wasm file, or packaged file data as mentioned lower down). For these browsers you’ll need to serve the files using a [local webserver](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/FAQ.html#faq-local-webserver) and then open http://localhost:8000/hello.html."_
  - Emscripten SDK has a handy `emrun` command: `emrun web/example_glfw_wgpu.html --browser firefox` which will spawn a temporary local webserver (in Firefox). See https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Running-html-files-with-emrun.html for details.
  - You may use Python 3 builtin webserver: `python -m http.server -d web` (this is what `make serve` uses).
  - You may use Python 2 builtin webserver: `cd web && python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.
  - If you are accessing the files over a network, certain browsers, such as Firefox, will restrict Gamepad API access to secure contexts only (e.g. https only).
